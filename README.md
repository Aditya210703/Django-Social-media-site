HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Front-end development is powered by these technologies to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Django: A high-level Python web framework is used to handle server-side logic, manage databases, and create a robust backend.

Django REST Framework: This framework is used to build APIs for features like real-time notifications and messaging.

Database: We use Django's built-in database system (SQLite by default) for development, but you can switch to other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL in production.

WebSockets: WebSocket technology is employed for real-time features like chat and notifications.
